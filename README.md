# Portfolio site

This is the first of the Udacity Front-end Nonodegree Program projects. It is a simple one page portfolio featuring responsive design using the bootstrap framework.
It contains all the projects that I worked on during this Nanodegree program.
You can find a link to my github account in the header and links to each project github page.
